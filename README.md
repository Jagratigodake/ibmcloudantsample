# Create a File Submission Web Application using Cloudant and PHP Boilerplate

## Learning Objectives
This guide shows you how can you create and deploy a PHP web application on IBM Cloud and connect and manage a Cloudant database instance on IBM Cloud.
You will also learn how to fetch the required data from cloudant using search index queries.

## Prerequisites
- An IBM Cloud Account. (You can create one here, and get 30 days free trial)
- IBM Cloud Command Line Interface
- GIT Command Line Interface

## Estimated Time
These steps will take you approximately 60 minutes.This does not include creating an IBM Cloud account(if you donâ€™t have one) or downloading the IBM Cloud CLI. It includes 10 minutes for creating cloudant service and generating credentials. Creating and the initial starting of PHP Service instance takes 10 minutes. Cloning the sample code and doing the modifications can take you around 15-25 minutes. Deploying the code to the PHP Service using IBM Cloud CLI can take 10 minutes.

## Steps
In this guide you will perform following steps:
Create a Cloudant Service on IBM Cloud and generate credentials.
Creating Database and Search Index in Cloudant DB
Creating a PHP Service on IBM Cloud.
Cloning the sample from GitHub.
Making necessary modifications in the sample code before deployment.
Deploying local code to the PHP service using IBM Cloud CLI.
